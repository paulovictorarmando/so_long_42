# SO_LONG

###
So_long is a 42 project focused on creating a simple 2D game using the MiniLibX library. The goal is to develop a program where the player collects items, avoids obstacles, and reaches the exit of a map configured in a .ber file format. It emphasizes graphics handling, event management, and game logic.
